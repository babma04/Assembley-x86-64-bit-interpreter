"""
Shared setup for tests/.

Finds the project root by walking upward looking for `pyproject.toml`,
rather than looking for a specific nested source directory. Anchoring on
the marker file (not a hardcoded path shape like `_src/bridges` or
`interpreter/_src/bridges`) means internal folder reorganizations never
break this again -- pyproject.toml only moves if the whole project moves,
and if that happens the fix is the same either way: nothing, since the
walk-up still finds it relative to wherever the repo now lives.

This project is pip-installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .` from
the project root, see pyproject.toml), which makes `bridges`, `FUs`,
`helpers`, and `parsing` importable as top-level packages
(`from bridges.register_manager import ...`) regardless of where the repo
sits on disk. This conftest no longer manually inserts bridges/ onto
sys.path -- that's what previously broke every time _src moved, and it's
no longer needed once the editable install is in place.

If you ever relocate the whole repo to a new path, just re-run
`pip install -e .` once from the new location.
